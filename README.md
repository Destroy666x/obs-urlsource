## Introduction

The URL/API Source is a plugin for [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) that allows users to add a media source that fetches data from a URL or API endpoint and displays it as text. [OBS Forums page](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/url-api-source-fetch-live-data-and-display-it-on-screen.1756/) | [Blog post](https://www.morethantechnical.com/2023/08/10/url-api-source-obs-plugin/)

If this free plugin has been valuable to you consider adding a ‚≠ê to this GH repo, rating it [on OBS](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/url-api-source-fetch-live-data-and-display-it-on-screen.1756/), subscribing to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@royshilk) where I post updates, and supporting my work: https://github.com/sponsors/royshil

## Building

The plugin was built and tested on Mac OSX  (Intel & Apple silicon), Windows and Linux.

Start by cloning this repo to a directory of your choice.

### Mac OSX

Using the CI pipeline scripts, locally you would just call the zsh script. By default this builds a universal binary for both Intel and Apple Silicon. To build for a specific architecture please see `.github/scripts/.build.zsh` for the `-arch` options.

```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/build-macos -c Release
```

#### Install
The above script should succeed and the plugin files (e.g. `obs-urlsource.plugin`) will reside in the `./release/Release` folder off of the root. Copy the `.plugin` file to the OBS directory e.g. `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins`.

To get `.pkg` installer file, run for example
```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/package-macos -c Release
```
(Note that maybe the outputs will be in the `Release` folder and not the `install` folder like `pakage-macos` expects, so you will need to rename the folder from `build_x86_64/Release` to `build_x86_64/install`)

### Linux (Ubuntu)

Use the CI scripts again
```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/build-linux.sh
```

Copy the results to the standard OBS folders on Ubuntu
```sh
$ sudo cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/lib/* /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
$ sudo cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/share/* /usr/share/
```
Note: The official [OBS plugins guide](https://obsproject.com/kb/plugins-guide) recommends adding plugins to the `~/.config/obs-studio/plugins` folder.

### Windows

Use the CI scripts again, for example:

```powershell
> .github/scripts/Build-Windows.ps1 -Target x64 -CMakeGenerator "Visual Studio 17 2022"
```

The build should exist in the `./release` folder off the root. You can manually install the files in the OBS directory.
